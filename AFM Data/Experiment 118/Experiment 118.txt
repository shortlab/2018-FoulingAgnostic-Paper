Ag probe with reduced matrix in water AFM

4:06 PM - recalling earlier random probe order from E115, today I will continue on with Ag probe. Only one of these remains - Novascan 22 - so I will try to be careful.

	24
	25
5:17 - switching samples. microsphere confirmed
5:21 - loading sample B2.1.1 S1, sample was wiped with isopropyl alcohol then rinsed with water droplet due to it being dropped during loading. conditions 21.4/62.3

	26 drifting up fast
	27 ok
	28 ok, some lf
	29
	30 some divergent noise removed
	31 ok
	32
	33

Experiment 117
6/30/2017
Using a Ni-coated 4um probe with different mineral and coated substrates

12:30 AM - AFM turned on to warm up
2:39 - 'fresh' water put in syringe, removing probe Novascan 49 (R13 C26 confirmed) - cantilever broken
2:43 - Novascan 12 and samples put under DI fan
2:53 - Novascan 12 (R15 C11 confirmed) installed in AFM. Microsphere confirmed. Samples covered up and DI fan turned off.
4:35 - turning off AFM after a very productive time

10:57 PM - AFM turned on to warm up, 'fresh' water put in syringe
11:31 - this time I will not record mV values, relying instead on the 'work of adhesion' script to calculate them later. I will still record FD settings, and will still try to maintain a maximum contact force of .0150 V. I will also use the SiC calibration sample, to have a reference point for the script.
11:36 - order of samples carried over from E115:
	SiC calibration sample (B13 S1, 5.318 mm)
	Calcite solid (B1.1.1 S7, 3.546 mm)
	Cryolite solid (B2.1.1 S4, 2.119 mm)
	Fluorite coated (B3.4 S38-F, 1.207 mm)
	ITO Coated (B4.1 S2-C, 1.601 mm)
	Uncoated Si (B3.4 S38-U, 1.119 mm)
	Quartz solid (B2.1.1 S1, 2.294 mm)
	Quartz coated (B3.4 S38-Q, 1.182 mm)
	FTO Coated (B4.1 S1-C, 2.584 mm)
	Cryolite coated (B3.4 S38-C,1.120 mm)
	SiC calibration sample (B13 S1, 5.318 mm)
12:01 AM - loading sample B13 S1, conditions 20.4/62.1
12:05 - landed Z=5.250 mm, snapshot taken, other samples placed under DI fan
12:06 - FD Parameters: 500 nm range, 1000 nm/sec speed, 2000 samples, wait time 1000 ms.
12:15 - SiC curves saved as 0, 1. However there were some poor plots initially, I tried 3 different spots and quality of FD curves seems to be improving. Perhaps there was charge or bacteria earlier.
12:19 - switching samples. DI fan turned off and rest of samples covered. 250-300 nm offset for FD curves is used. B13 S1 placed under DI fan for a little bit.
12:24 - microsphere confirmed. loading sample B1.1.1 S7, conditions 20.8/60.0
12:30 - landed Z=3.173 mm, snapshot taken, starting measurements
